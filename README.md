# React Workout Clock

- Inspired by [This Mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/3230197-Workout-Tracker/attachments/691346)
- This is a refactor of a previous vanilla Javascript app to a React one
- To get this going:
  - In the root of the directory run `yarn` to install the dependencies (did you make sure you have yarn.js installed?)
  - Run `npm run start` to boot the app
  - This app was built on top of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) build tool, so check that out for more info and to build one of your own

## Viva React!
